1)
What is the key characteristic of a functions ?

A function is non-contiguous repeating code - it takes arguments and returns only one data type


2)
What facts of reality give rise to the need to create functions ?

I want to do the same thing at different times, and I'm lazy.


3)
What is the function header ?

The function header is what defines the return type of the function, it's name, and its arguments


4)
What is the function body ?

The functions body tells the function what to do and includes a return statement


5)
What are system defined functions ?

System defined functions are things that c++ already knows by default - like loops.


6)
What are user defined 
function ?

User defined functions are things that I make to enable my lazyness.


7)
What are the 4 ways to set up a function ?

No value in, no return value; no arguments with return; no return with arguments; both arguments and return 


8)
What is a function prototype ?

A function prototype is also called the function header.

9)
Where can you place a function definition ?

The whole thing can be at the top, or only the prototype can be at the top and the rest can be lower.


10)
What is a function argument ?

Arguments are input data, and can be any valid data type

11)
What are the 3 key features of function arguments ?

The function arguments can be bool, int, long, str, char, etc; and tbey have to be called out in the definition

12)
What does a #include <libraryName> statemen
t do ?

the include function includes prewritten functions like sqrt() or abs() or cout.


13)
Find a website online that has a list of C++ predefined functions.

http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~cop3014p/lectures/ch6_new/index.html

14)
How many different types of math functions are there in the predefined ‘math’ library ?

http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/ over 80!

15)
What types of statements can you put in the body of a function?

Any statement you want - its just like a block of code.
