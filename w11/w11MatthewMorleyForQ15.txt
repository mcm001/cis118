1) What facts of reality give rise for the need of Loops ?
Programmers are really lazy, so loops make everything easier.

2) What are the three parts governing a for loop ?
The initial code, the condition, and the imcrament parts.

3) What is an Infinite Loop ?
An infinite loop never exits.

4) Write a Condition that would result in an infinite loop.
if (int x=1; x<2; )
	do stuff

5) What type of Sequence is a loop ?
Repeating sequence

6) What does the flow chart for a for loop look like ?
Blocks of code connected to each other with a line to the top

7) What is the differences between a pre-test and post-test loop ?
One checks the condition before code execution, the other after.

8) What is a nested for loop ? Give an example.
A loop in a loop
if (int x=1; x < 100, x++) {
if (int y=1; y<100, y++) {
do stuff
}
do other stuff
}

9) What does the setw() function do ? Did you use it in your code ?


10) Which is better ?
a. Write a block of code 10 times
b. Write a block of code 1 time and copy and paste 9 more times
c. Write a block of code 1 time and place it in a loop structue that repeats it 10
times
The last one - less work

11) Research online, the three conditions in the for loop. Which do you need, which can you
do without ?
You don't really need all 3 within a loop, but you can put them outside

12) Why do lazy programmers use loops ?
Because it's less work to use loops

13) What does ‘contiguous’ mean ?
The loops' code repeats one after the other

14) How are a simple sequence and a loop different ?
Loops repeat a variable number of times based on a condition - a simple sequence just goes

15) Why do you like or dislike loops ?
I like loops, but not in c++ - python loops are better and easier for me to think about.
