1) What does pass by value do ?Give a simple code example of a function header and a callâ€¦

Pass by value is like writing down a number in you head and handing it to the person next to you to read and remember. For example,
int function( int input ) {
}

2) What does pass by reference do ?Give a simple code example of a function header and a call

Pass by reference is like keeping a ledger on paper, filing it away, and someone else takes the same paper and works on it, puts it back, etc.

3) If you has an array of 100 elements, which is easier: a or b. Explain your answer.
    a. Defining a function with 100 different variables so you can pass all elements of an array into it
    b. Defining a function what passes just the location of the array, and you use the original array.

I would techincally choose (c), using an array in the function header and passing by value the whole array. But of the two, for sure b would be easier.

4) How is Passing just ONE value into a function rather than passing 100 separate value, like a concept ?

passing by reference using only one value is like a comcept because it reduces many things (like a whole essay) into one thing (like the dewydecimal location of a book in the library, or a URL, or a street address))

5) What are other names for pass by value and pass by reference ?

pass by value: AKA pass by copy
pass by reference: AKA pass by address, pass by location

6) Do you think pass by reference is used a lot or not ? Explain your answer ?

Not really? I've never used it before, and it will remain pretty niche. At a hardware or assembly code level it is used a lot though.
